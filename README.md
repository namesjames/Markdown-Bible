Everything you need to know for writing ðŸ”¥ markdown, by James Conti âˆ†\\\ 

_^if you're wondering how to insert emojis, `command+control+space` brings up the emoji keyboard._ 


# Basics:

## Headings:
We can set different heading sizes with the # symbol 

closing with # is _optional_

`#H1` 
`##H2`
`###H3`
`####H4`
`#####H5`
`######H6` =

# H1 
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5 
###### H6

## Text:

**BOLD** = `**before and after**` or `__text___`

_italicized_ = we use `_before and after_` or `*text*`

##[Hyperlinks:](http://www.#)

* [google](http://www.google.com/)

To achieve, you must surround your display text with brackets `[text]` then immediately followed by the url in parantheses `(url)`
> `[text](url)` 

## Bullet Points & Number
> Very simple, * = bullet points and numbering is self-explanatory, 1. 2. 3. (youre editor may auto populate for you when you `shift+enter`

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

1. one
2. two
3. three

> ## Quotes: 
>"Just add `>` before the text you wish to quote.

## `Code Bits`
add **`** before and after your code snipet 

## BONUS: Images!!!
Simply use: `![Alt Text](url)`
